We want people to use Meshtastic

- If people don’t know why your project exists, they won’t use it.
- If people can’t figure out how to install your code, they won’t use it.
- If people can’t figure out how to use your code, they won’t use it

We want people to contribute to the project.
This ensures it develops, and stays current and dependable.  Many hands make light work.

- You only get contributions after you have put in a lot of work.
- You only get contributions after you have users.
- You only get users after you have documentation.

## How do we get good documents?

- Understand what we are trying to achieve, hence
    - common purpose & agreed goals.
    - an overall design & structure for documents.
    - an approach for how we work: principles, standards, templates.
- Make it easy to contribute
    - simple tools, clear structure, 
    - know what to edit, where and when.
- Make them easy to use 
    - easy to find, linked to from apps, Discord, repos, ..
    - easy to feedback and edit.

That's what this document aims to achieve.


sources, this has been done before.

### Types (Functions) of documentation.

| Function: | Tutorials | Guides  | Reference  | Explanation |
| -----|-------- |----------| -----|---|
| *Purpose* | Learning  | a goal | information | understanding |
| Must      |allow the newcomer to get started|show how to solve a specific problem| fully describe the features	|explain how and why
| Form/Structure | Lesson |    step-by-step | factual description |discussion, explanation|
| Examples | Video on how to setup and run Meshtastic.   |  User guide for the Meshtastic Android app.  How to install and run the Python app. | List of commands and parameters.  API reference. | How does the mesh algorithm work? |

There are other documents like to-do lists, specifications, test plans, issues - these are for a small audience of developers and used in the development process.  Even developers need documents, more towards the right-hand columns.

### People who need documents

| Type | New | User | Enthusiast (technical or functional) | Contributor (Developer, Author)  | Maintainer |
| -----|-------- |----------| -----|---| ---|
| Persona |   | |  |  |
| They think:      |This project looks interesting, how do I find out if this is for me?|I just want to use Meshtastic.| I'd like to experiment, configure and learn more, and suggest use-cases and ideas.	|I'd like to contribute to code, documentation, testing. | I can maintain a repo or application, and review, edit and  publish.
|  |  |     |   |  |
| They need to: | read about capabilities, understand what they need to get started.   |  get hardware, install and run some Meshtastic apps, report issues and keep updated. | may want to test range or performance, or build a IoT sensor mesh.  | Implement a feature, or fix an issue.  Write a document or make a video. | Review Pull requests, build a release, publish documentation.
